# Deploy a Smart Contract on Testnet



## Configuring Flint Wallet

Flint Wallet is a Chrome extension that serves as a go-to light wallet for DeFi and NFTs. The current version of Flint allows users to create a Cardano Testnet wallet and enable "Milkomeda mode" to send transactions to the Milkomeda C1 sidechain.

Install Flint Wallet by visiting the following link while using Chrome browser and clicking the “Add to Chrome” button: [Install Flint Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/flint/hnhobjmcibchnmglfbldbfabcgaknlkj)​

After installing, click the Extensions icon <img src={puzzleIcon} className="img-icon" /> at the top right of the Chrome window and select **Flint Wallet**. Within the Flint window, proceed past the initial warning screen, click “**Let’s Begin**”, choose your language, click “**I agree**”, and when you arrive at the screen shown below, click the “**Testnet**” button.

Next, click “**Confirm**”, “**Create a new wallet**”, and write down a copy of your recovery phrase.

Confirm the recovery phrase at the next screen, set a wallet password, and click “**Create my wallet**”. For now you can select “**Skip**” at the App Passcode screen, and then click “**Finish**”. You should now have a Cardano Testnet wallet, as shown:

![Flint home screen](/img/flint-home-screen.png)

Next, we will access the Cardano Testnet faucet to obtain some test ADA.


## Obtaining Test ADA

Now we’re ready to get some test ADA from the Cardano testnet faucet.

:::info

If you will be using real ADA on the mainnet version of Milkomeda C1, skip this step and proceed to the next section

:::

Within the Flint Wallet window, click "**Receive**". At the Receive window, click "**Copy Address**" to copy your Cardano Testnet wallet address to the clipboard, and then click "**Testnet faucet (tADA)**" at the bottom of the screen, as shown.

![](/img/flint-copy-tada-receive-address.png)​

This will take you to the following link: [Cardano Testnet Faucet](https://testnets.cardano.org/en/testnets/cardano/tools/faucet/)​

Here, select "tAda" from the dropdown menu and paste your Cardano testnet wallet address into the "Address" field. You can leave the "API Key" field blank.

![](/img/cardano-testnet-faucet.png)

Complete the Captcha and click "**Request funds**".

After waiting a few minutes (usually 5 minutes or less), you should be able to see some tADA in your Cardano Testnet wallet.

![](/img/flint-confirm-tada-balance.png)

Next we will set up MetaMask and get an address on the Milkomeda C1 sidechain.

## Configuring MetaMask

Now that we have a Cardano testnet wallet and some Test ADA, we need an address on the Milkomeda Cardano Testnet sidechain where we can receive our MilkTADA. For now, we recommend using MetaMask for this step.

First, install [MetaMask for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn). Then, click the Chrome Extensions icon <img src={puzzleIcon} className="img-icon" /> and select MetaMask. Within the MetaMask window, click "**Get Started**" and then "**Create a Wallet**". Set a wallet password and click through the rest of the setup screens. When finished, you should have a new empty wallet, as shown below. Select the network dropdown at the top right of the MetaMask screen.

![](/img/metamask-change-network.png)

From the dropdown list, select “**Add Network**” and enter the following:

> Network Name: Milkomeda Cardano Testnet
>
> <p>New RPC URL: https://rpc-devnet-cardano-evm.c1.milkomeda.com</p>
>
> Chain ID: 200101
>
> Currency Symbol (Optional): milkTADA
>
> <p> Block Explorer URL (Optional): https://explorer-devnet-cardano-evm.c1.milkomeda.com </p>

If you need a WebSocket endpoint, use the following: wss://rpc-devnet-cardano-evm.c1.milkomeda.com

:::info

To use the mainnet version of Milkomeda C1, enter the following parameters instead:

- Network Name: Milkomeda Cardano (C1)
- <span>New RPC URL: https://rpc-mainnet-cardano-evm.c1.milkomeda.com</span>
- Chain ID: 2001
- Currency Symbol: milkADA
- <span> Block Explorer URL: https://explorer-mainnet-cardano-evm.c1.milkomeda.com </span>

If you need a WebSocket endpoint, use the following: wss://rpc-mainnet-cardano-evm.c1.milkomeda.com
:::

Click “**Save**”, and you should now see "**Milkomeda Cardano Testnet**" in the network dropdown. Copy your Milkomeda Cardano Testnet wallet address to the clipboard by clicking on the account name, as shown.

![Metamask copy address](/img/metamask-copy-c1-testnet-address.png)

Next we will go back to Flint Wallet and send our test ADA to be wrapped.


## Wrapping Assets

Open the Flint Wallet window and click "**Send**". At the next screen, enable the "**Milkomeda mode**" toggle, paste your Milkomeda C1 wallet address into the "**Milkomeda Ethereum Address**" field, and enter the amount to send (300 Test ADA in this example). Click "**Continue**".

![](/img/flint-wrap-tada.png)

At the confirmation screen, enter your wallet password and click "**Send**".

![](/img/flint-wrap-tada-confirm.png)

The transfer will require 10 confirmations, which should take approximately **5** minutes. Once the transaction is confirmed, the transferred MilkTADA should be visible in your Milkomeda Cardano Testnet wallet in MetaMask.

:::info A note on transaction fees

For transactions that take place solely on the Milkomeda C1 sidechain, you only pay the standard Milkomeda network transaction fee set by the block producers.

However, transactions that involve wrapping, i.e., moving assets between Cardano and the Milkomeda C1 sidechain, require payment of transactions fees for both Cardano and Milkomeda since one transaction is required on each chain.

For example, sending assets from Cardano to Milkomeda C1 requires one transaction on Cardano to lock your assets and another transaction on Milkomeda C1 to issue the wrapped assets to you.

When sending a transaction of this type in Flint Wallet, you can expand the "Network Fee" item to see a "Base Fee" (i.e., the Cardano transaction fee) and a "Milkomeda Fee". Note that the "Milkomeda Fee" for these transactions will be slightly higher than the standard transaction fee on Milkomeda since you are also paying the block producers for their role in wrapping your assets.

:::

Now that we have successfully wrapped Test ADA into MilkTADA for use on the Milkomeda Cardano Testnet sidechain, the next step is to deploy a sample smart contract.

:::caution MilkTADA and Wrapped Test ADA

As we have seen, MilkTADA is the base asset used for paying fees and gas on the Milkomeda Cardano Testnet sidechain. When you move Test ADA to Milkomeda, you receive MilkTADA.

"Wrapped Test ADA" (wTADA) is a separate ERC20 token that functions the same as WETH on Ethereum.

The contract address for wTADA can be found below. Note that although you can send milkTADA to this address to wrap it, you **shouldn't** send wTADA to this address to unwrap it but rather interact with it using the right method in the smart-contract. wTADA contract address: 0x65a51E52eCD17B641f8F0D1d56a6c9738951FDC9

If using the Cardano mainnet, find the wADA contract address below.

**Do not directly** send wADA to this address. For now, you will need to use a DEX to unwrap wADA (or interact directly with the smart contract).

wADA contract address: 0xAE83571000aF4499798d1e3b0fA0070EB3A3E3F9

## Deploying a Smart Contract

Here we will deploy a Solidity smart contract on the Milkomeda C1 sidechain. In this example, we will use Remix [](http://remix.ethereum.org/) to deploy the contract. You can access Remix by visiting the following link: [Remix IDE](http://remix.ethereum.org/)​

First, create the solidity smart contract file. Inside the Remix window, click the "**Contracts**" folder in the left panel, then click the "**New File**" button in the central panel.

![](/img/remix-new-file.png)

Now you will be prompted to enter a filename for a new Solidity smart contract. The filename is arbitrary, but for the purposes of this example we will be deploying an ERC-20 smart contract so we will name the file "Test_ERC20.sol". Type the filename and press **Enter**. The cursor should move to the edit panel where you can input your Solidity code. Enter the following:

```
pragma solidity ^0.7.0;

import "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v3.4.0-solc-0.7/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract Token is ERC20 {

    constructor () ERC20("Token", "TKN") {
        _mint(msg.sender, 1000000 * (10 ** uint256(decimals())));
    }
}
```

Next, click the "**Solidity compiler**" icon on the left side of the screen, choose a compiler version (for this example we will use **0.7.6+commit.7338295f**), and then click "**Compile Test_ERC20.sol**", as shown.

![](/img/remix-compile.png)

Click the "**Deploy and run transactions**" icon on the left, and from the "**Environment**" pulldown select "**Injected Web3**", as shown. This will bring up the MetaMask screen where you will need to click "**Next**" and then "**Connect**" to connect your C1 wallet with Remix.

![](/img/remix-connect-wallet.png)

With your MetaMask wallet now connected, click the "**Deploy**" button to deploy the smart contract to the Milkomeda C1 sidechain.

![](/img/remix-deploy.png)

Confirm the transaction in MetaMask.

![](/img/remix-deploy-confirm.png)

You should now see the following under "**Deployed Contracts**" on the left side of the Remix IDE screen.

Finally, let's look at how to unwrap our milkTADA back into tADA on the Cardano Testnet.
