# Brownie

Brownie is currently in maintenance mode and ApeworX should be itâ€™s successor, but in any case we will lease here the steps to set it up.

Steps
Initialize a brownie project in an empty folder: 

```
brownie init
```

Copy the WinnerDraw.sol to the contracts folder.
Compile the contract:

```
brownie compile
```

Add the Milkomeda C1 testnet list of networks in brownie:

```
brownie networks add Milkomeda milkomeda-cardano-testnet chainid=200101 explorer=https://explorer-devnet-cardano-evm.c1.milkomeda.com host=https://rpc-devnet-cardano-evm.c1.milkomeda.com name="Milkomeda C1 Testnet"
```


Create a file named brownie-config.yml in the root of the project with the following content:

```
dotenv: .env
wallets:
  - dummy: ${PRIVATE_KEY}
```

Create a file named .env with the private key of the funded account:

```
PRIVATE_KEY=<PRIVATE_KEY>
```


Create a file named deploy.py in the scripts folder:

```
from brownie import WinnerDraw, accounts, config

def main():
    signer = accounts.add(config['wallets'][0]['dummy'])
    WinnerDraw.deploy({"from": signer})
```


Run the deployment script on C1 testnet:

```
brownie run scripts/deploy.py --network milkomeda-cardano-testnet
```
