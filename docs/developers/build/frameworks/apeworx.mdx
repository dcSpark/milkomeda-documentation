Plugins are core to ApeworX’s architecture and to add a new network, it has to be bundled into a plugin. Luckily, dcspark has developed a plugin (ape-milkomeda)  to allow Apeworx to connect to A1 and C1, mainnet and testnet.

Download is available at…

Steps
Install the ape-milkomeda plugin to have the milkomeda chains available in the ApeworX network list.

Either download the repo and install from source:

```
git glone https://github.com/dcspark/ape-milkomeda
cd ape-milkomeda
pip install .
```

or install from the pypi repository (I have finished plugin but it’s only on my pc):

```
pip install ape-milkomeda
```


Initialize an ape project in an empty folder:

```
ape init
```

Copy the WinnerDraw.sol to the contracts folder.
Compile the contract:

```
ape compile
```

Import your account to ApeworX account list:

```
ape accounts import <ALIAS>
```

(you will be prompted for the private key and a passphrase to encrypt it)


Create a file names deploy.py in the scripts folder:

```
from ape import project, accounts

def main():
    signer = accounts.load('test')
    winnerDraw = signer.deploy(project.WinnerDraw)
```

Run the deployment script on C1 testnet:

```
ape run deploy --network milkomeda:c1-testnet
```
