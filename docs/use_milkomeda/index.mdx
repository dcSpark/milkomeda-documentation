**Milkomeda** is a groundbreaking new protocol that brings EVM capabilities to non-EVM blockchains. As development progresses, Milkomeda will expand to offer L2 solutions (rollups) for several major blockchains including Cardano, Solana, and Algorand. Currently we have an EVM-based sidechain connected to Cardano - <strong>Milkomeda C1</strong> and EVM-based Rollup connected to Algorand - <strong>Milkomeda A1</strong>.
