# For End Users

:::info
Milkomeda C1 **Testnet** is not recommended for use at this time due to recent Cardano Testnet developments. New dedicated preview and pre-production Cardano Testnet environments are being introduced and old Testnet is going to be deprecated very soon. Due to that fact there may appear difficulties with moving funds between Cardano and Milkomeda C1 Sidechain (Testnet). 

Taking this into consideration, we recommend all users who would like to deploy their contracts on Milkomeda C1 Sidechain (Testnet), to perform testing on any other EVM-compatible chain instead. The main issue is that to pay the fees on Milkomeda C1 Testnet, one must wrap test assets using Cardano Testnet which may not be possible.

Thanks to Milkomeda C1 EVM-compatibility, such contracts can be deployed on any Ethereum Virtual Machine, so even if a contract is tested elsewhere, it will work on the Milkomeda C1 Sidechain.
:::

The Milkomeda C1 sidechain uses MilkADA as its base asset for paying fees and gas. To access the sidechain, you will need a Cardano wallet with some ADA as well as the MetaMask browser extension.

On the following pages we will walk through the steps to create a Cardano wallet in Flint, configure MetaMask to get a Milkomeda C1 address, and finally send ADA to be converted into MilkADA on Milkomeda C1.

Our first step is to install Flint Wallet. Proceed to the next page to begin.
