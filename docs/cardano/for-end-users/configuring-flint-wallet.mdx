# Configuring Flint Wallet

Flint Wallet is a Chrome extension that serves as a convenient go-to light wallet for DeFi and NFTs. The current
version of Flint allows users to enable "Milkomeda mode" to send transactions to the Milkomeda C1 sidechain. Install
Flint Wallet by visiting the following link while using Chrome browser and clicking the “Add to Chrome” button:
[Install Flint Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/flint/hnhobjmcibchnmglfbldbfabcgaknlkj)

After installing, click the "puzzle piece" icon <img src={puzzleIcon} className="img-icon" />
at the top right of the Chrome window to access your extensions. Select **Flint**. Within the Flint Wallet window, proceed past the initial warning screen, click “**Let’s Begin**”, choose your language, click “**I agree**”, and when you arrive at the screen shown below, click the “**Mainnet**” button.

Next, click “**Confirm**”, “**Create a new wallet**”, and write down a copy of your recovery phrase.

Confirm the recovery phrase at the next screen, set a wallet password, and click “**Create my wallet**”. For now you can select “**Skip**” at the App Passcode screen, and then click “**Finish**”. You should now have a Cardano wallet, as shown:

Note that to proceed further you will need to fund your wallet with some ADA. Refer to the "[Get Help](../../get-help)" section at the end of this document if you require assistance or encounter trouble at this stage.

Next, we will configure MetaMask to connect to the Milkomeda C1 sidechain.
