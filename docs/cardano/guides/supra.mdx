# Building on Milkomeda with SupraOracles

You can use [Supra Pull Oracles](https://supraoracles.com/docs/price-feeds/pull-model/) with Milkomeda. You can see the full data catalogue available [here](https://supraoracles.com/docs/price-feeds/data-feeds-catalog/).

Supra provides decentralized oracle price feeds that can be used for on-chain and off-chain use-cases such as spot and perpetual DEXes, lending protocols, and payments protocols.

Supra’s oracle chain has its own consensus algorithm to try and achieve fast response times and fast finality.

Supra’s rotating node architecture gathers data from 40+ data sources and performs calculations to try to get an accurate value. The node provenance on the [data dashboard](https://supraoracles.com/data) also provides a historical audit trail.

You can also check out their developer docs [here](https://supraoracles.com/docs/overview), or learn more about the R&D behind SupraOracles [here](https://supra.com/research).
