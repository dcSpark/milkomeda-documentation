# For Developers

:::info
Milkomeda C1 **Testnet** is not recommended for use at this time due to recent Cardano Testnet developments. New dedicated preview and pre-production Cardano Testnet environments are being introduced and old Testnet is going to be deprecated very soon. Due to that fact there may appear difficulties with moving funds between Cardano and Milkomeda C1 Sidechain (Testnet). 

Taking this into consideration, we recommend all users who would like to deploy their contracts on Milkomeda C1 Sidechain (Testnet), to perform testing on any other EVM-compatible chain instead. The main issue is that to pay the fees on Milkomeda C1 Testnet, one must wrap test assets using Cardano Testnet which may not be possible.

Thanks to Milkomeda C1 EVM-compatibility, such contracts can be deployed on any Ethereum Virtual Machine, so even if a contract is tested elsewhere, it will work on the Milkomeda C1 Sidechain.
:::
Two versions of the Milkomeda C1 sidechain are currently operational. One is the devnet version, which uses test ADA and interacts with the Cardano Testnet. The the other is the mainnet version, which uses real ADA and interacts with the Cardano mainnet.

We recommend starting with the devnet to get oriented first. Once you're familiar with the devnet, the operations for mainnet are the same. The example steps that follow will show how to set up a connection to the devnet, with additional sections in red text indicating parameters and steps for using the mainnet.

Our first step is to install Flint Wallet. Proceed to the next page to begin.
