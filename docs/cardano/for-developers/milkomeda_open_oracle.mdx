# Milkomeda Open Oracle Developer guide

:::info
Milkomeda C1 Sidechain is fully operational on Mainnet, which means that it is currently deployed and connected to production version of the Cardano blockchain.
:::


##  Introduction

The Milkomeda Open Oracle (MOO) is a decentralized oracle service for a USD/ADA pricefeed with a minimal governance system. It permits multiple owners to post data, and the majority of the current owners can add or remove owners. 

Sources are checked every ~10 seconds, outliers are removed if the prices they provide differ from the mean by more than 2 standard deviations and the mean of the remaining prices is calculated as the final value. If the new mean price differs from the last price posted on the blockchain by more than 1%, the new mean price is posted and the price is updated on the blockchain.

Developers have several options to fetch prices from the oracle contract. They can integrate the oracle interface into their smart contracts, allowing them to access on-chain data updated at regular intervals as input to any logic that the smart contract might have. Alternatively, developers can call the oracle contract directly with languages like Javascript/Typescript to use the price feed on a DApp frontend.

Those interested in going through the Smart Contract, can check out the in the [public repo](https://github.com/DjedAlliance/Oracle-Solidity).

The latest version of the oracle is the **Aggregator 3 Oracle (A3O)** contract, that offers the security of not relying on a single price feed for the output, but rather reports the median of the latest 3 data points written by distinct owners.

In this guide, we will provide an example using Javascript, Python and inside a Smart Contract, requiring the Milkomeda Open Oracle's ABI which is accessible [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DjedAlliance/Oracle-Solidity/main/abi/Aggr3Oracle.json), and the contract's deployment address, found in the following table:


| Milkomeda C1 | Open Oracle Deployment address |
|---|---|
| Mainnet | 0x49484Ae8646C12A8A68DfE2c978E9d4Fa5b01D16  |
| Devnet | 0x2a16a70E71D2C6f07F02b221B441a2e35E3d0848 |

It is crucial to note that to leverage the capabilities of the Milkomeda Open Oracle, the caller of the read function must agree to the terms of service, which are accessible [here](https://ext-oracle-disclaimer.milkomeda.com/disclaimer.pdf).  This is a one-time requirement (per address), and we will provide guidance on how to accomplish that in this guide.

For the purposes of this tutorial, we will be utilizing the Milkomeda C1 Testnet. However, the implementation process is identical on the C1 Mainnet, and the only adjustment necessary would be the deployment address.

## Calling the Price Feed

### Price Feed using Javascript

To call the price feed using Javascript, we will use the `ethers` (^6) package, under the assumption that the Terms of Service have not yet been accepted, indicating that the contract is being called for the first time from our address.

Let’s create a new javascript project with a script that can be called from the command line. This can easily be adapted to be used for a frontend in a browser.
Navigate to a new folder where you want to create your project. In a new folder, create an empty project and add the ethers and dotenv packages.

```bash
yarn init -y
yarn add ethers dotenv
```

Navigate to the root directory of your project. Create a .env file with the private key for the account you intend to use:

```
PRIVATE_KEY=<PRIVATE_KEY>
```

NOTE: Remember to keep your private key safe from prying eyes. It is recommended to use a new separate account just for testing purposes.

Now let’s create a file named “callPriceFeed.js” and add the imports and initial setup.

```javascript
const ethers = require("ethers");
require("dotenv").config();
const abi = require('./Oracle.json').abi

const rpcURL = "https://rpc-devnet-cardano-evm.c1.milkomeda.com"
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(rpcURL)
const signer = new ethers.Wallet( `0x${process.env.PRIVATE_KEY}`, provider )
const oracle = new ethers.Contract("0x49484Ae8646C12A8A68DfE2c978E9d4Fa5b01D16", abi, signer)
```


After importing the `ethers` and `dotenv` package, we’re importing the `Oracle.json` that contains the ABI and setting up a provider, signer and an instance of the oracle contract. Notice we are using the rpc URL and deployment address for Milkomeda C1 Testnet.

To get the price feed for USD from the oracle we need to call the readData() function, like so:

```javascript
const getPriceFeed = async () => {
    const price = await oracle.readData()
    console.log("Price:", ethers.formatEther(price))
}

getPriceFeed()
```

However, if you are running the readData function for the first time, the transaction will fail because, although it is a read function, it requires the caller of the function to have accepted the Term of Service. That acceptance is stored in the smart contract as a mapping and can be queried by calling the acceptedTermsOfService function and providing an address.

```javascript
oracle.acceptedTermsOfService(signer.address)
.then(resp => console.log("Accepted Terms of Service:", resp))
```

Making this call should output “Accepted Terms of Service: false” which means that calling the readData() function will fail.





In the `getPriceFeed` function of our script, we can add a test to check if the terms of service have been accepted and call the accept function if needed. Let’s add that to the `getPriceFeed` function.

We will also add a function call to retrieve the description of the price feed:

```javascript
oracle.description().then(resp => console.log("Description:", resp))
```


<details><summary>See the final script</summary>
<p>

```javascript
const ethers = require("ethers");
require("dotenv").config();
const abi = require('./Oracle.json').abi

const rpcURL = "https://rpc-devnet-cardano-evm.c1.milkomeda.com"
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(rpcURL)
const signer = new ethers.Wallet( `0x${process.env.PRIVATE_KEY}`, provider )
const oracle = new ethers.Contract("0x49484Ae8646C12A8A68DfE2c978E9d4Fa5b01D16", abi, signer)


// oracle.acceptedTermsOfService(signer.address)
// .then(resp => console.log("Accepted Terms of Service:", resp))

oracle.description()
.then(resp => console.log("Description:", resp))


const getPriceFeed = async () => {
    const accepted = await oracle.acceptedTermsOfService(signer.address)
    if (!accepted) {
        console.log("Accepting ToS...")
        const tx = await oracle.acceptTermsOfService();
        await tx.wait();    
    }
    const price = await oracle.readData()
    console.log("Price:", ethers.formatEther(price))
}

getPriceFeed()
```


</p>
</details>






Running `node callPriceFeed.js` for the first time will output the following lines (the price will probably be different):

**
Description: ADA/USD<br></br>
Accepting ToS...<br></br>
Price: 2.8398199554148265
**

Subsequent calls to the function, from the same address, will only show the description and the price since the call to `acceptedTermsOfService(address)` will return true.


:::info

The result from the price feed,  approx 2.84 (formatted from 18 decimals), is the amount of USD in ADA. Readers are probably used to seeing the price of ADA in USD, which would be the inverse of the result.

USD/ADA = 2.8398199554148265

ADA/USD = 1 / (USD/ADA) = 1 / 2.8398199554148265 = 0.352135
:::


### Price Feed Using Python

To call the price feed using Python, we will use the `web3py` package, under the assumption that the Terms of Service have not yet been accepted, indicating that the contract is being called for the first time from our address.

Let’s create a new python script that can be called from the command line. 

First, create a new virtual environment and activate it: 

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install web3py python-dotenv
```

Create a .env file with the private key for the account you intend to use:

```
PRIVATE_KEY=<PRIVATE_KEY>
```

NOTE: Remember to keep your private key safe from prying eyes. It is recommended to use a new separate account just for testing purposes.


Create a file called `call_price_feed.py` and write to it the following sections of code. 
We start with some imports and loading the values in the `.env` into a `config` variable:

```python
import requests
from dotenv import dotenv_values
from eth_account import Account
from web3 import Web3

config = dotenv_values(".env") 
```

We load an account from the private key in the `.env` and create a connection to Milkomeda.

```python
signer = Account.from_key(config['PRIVATE_KEY'])

rpc_url = "https://rpc-mainnet-cardano-evm.c1.milkomeda.com"


web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(rpc_url))
print("Connected to Milkomeda C1 Mainnet:", web3.is_connected())
```

The contract address will be hardcoded and we'll read the ABI from the repo.

```python
oracle_address = "0x49484Ae8646C12A8A68DfE2c978E9d4Fa5b01D16" # Mainnet

res = requests.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DjedAlliance/Oracle-Solidity/main/abi/Aggr3Oracle.json")
abi = res.json().get('abi')

oracle = web3.eth.contract(address=oracle_address, abi=abi)
```

We will write a helper function to sign the transaction

```python
def sign_and_send(txn, account):
    signed_txn = web3.eth.account.sign_transaction(txn, private_key=account._private_key)
    tx_hash = web3.eth.send_raw_transaction(signed_txn.rawTransaction)
    receipt = web3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt(tx_hash)
    return receipt

```

Then, a call will be made to the smart contract to check if the sender has accapted the terms of service, 
and if not, a call will be made to accept.



```python
print("Description:", oracle.functions.description().call())

has_accepted = oracle.functions.acceptedTermsOfService(signer.address).call()
if not has_accepted:
    print("Accepting ToS...")
    txn = oracle.functions.acceptTermsOfService().build_transaction({
            'gas': 700000,
            'gasPrice': Web3.to_wei('500', 'gwei'),
            'nonce': web3.eth.get_transaction_count(signer.address),
        })
    res = sign_and_send(txn, signer)

txn = oracle.functions.readData().call({'from': signer.address})
print("USD/ADA:", txn / 1e18)
```

Finally, there is call to the `readData()` to retrive the latest price from the oracle. Note the the "from" key in the call is required.


<details><summary>See the final script</summary>
<p>

```python
import requests
from dotenv import dotenv_values
from eth_account import Account
from web3 import Web3

config = dotenv_values(".env") 

signer = Account.from_key(config['PRIVATE_KEY'])

rpc_url = "https://rpc-mainnet-cardano-evm.c1.milkomeda.com"

web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(rpc_url))
print("Connected to Milkomeda C1 Mainnet:", web3.is_connected())


oracle_address = "0x49484Ae8646C12A8A68DfE2c978E9d4Fa5b01D16" # Mainnet

res = requests.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DjedAlliance/Oracle-Solidity/main/abi/Aggr3Oracle.json")
abi = res.json().get('abi')


oracle = web3.eth.contract(address=oracle_address, abi=abi)

def sign_and_send(txn, account):
    signed_txn = web3.eth.account.sign_transaction(txn, private_key=account._private_key)
    tx_hash = web3.eth.send_raw_transaction(signed_txn.rawTransaction)
    receipt = web3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt(tx_hash)
    return receipt


print("Description:", oracle.functions.description().call())

has_accepted = oracle.functions.acceptedTermsOfService(signer.address).call()
if not has_accepted:
    print("Accepting ToS...")
    txn = oracle.functions.acceptTermsOfService().build_transaction({
            'gas': 700000,
            'gasPrice': Web3.to_wei('500', 'gwei'),
            'nonce': web3.eth.get_transaction_count(signer.address),
        })
    res = sign_and_send(txn, signer)

txn = oracle.functions.readData().call({'from': signer.address})
print("Price:", txn / 1e18)
```

## Integrate Milkomeda Open Oracle into your Smart Contracts using Hardhat

To use the oracle in our smart contract, we need to interact with the oracle contract on the relevant chain while ensuring that our smart contract accepts the terms of service.

For testing purposes, we can use Hardhat, a development environment that enables us to compile, deploy, and test smart contracts in a local environment.

To set up Hardhat, create a new folder, initialize a JavaScript project, and install Hardhat by executing the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
yarn init -y
yarn add -D hardhat
```

Once Hardhat is installed, we need to initialize a new Hardhat project:

```bash
npx hardhat init
```

This will create a new Hardhat project with a basic directory structure and some example files.

Next, we need to create a new smart contract that will use the Milkomeda Open Oracle. Let's call it PriceFeedConsumer.sol.

Create a new file called `PriceFeedConsumer.sol` in the contracts directory of your project. Then, add the following code:

```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface IOracle {
    function readData() external view returns (uint256);
    function acceptTermsOfService() external;
}

contract PriceFeedConsumer {
    IOracle public oracle;
 
    constructor() {
        oracle = IOracle(0x49484Ae8646C12A8A68DfE2c978E9d4Fa5b01D16);
        oracle.acceptTermsOfService();
    }

    function getPrice() public view returns (uint256 data) {
        data = oracle.readData();
        // Contract logic...
    }
}
```

This smart contract uses a hardcoded deployment address for the oracle on Milkomeda C1 Mainnet. When the contract is deployed, the acceptTermsOfService function is called for the contract address in the constructor.

The contract has one function, `getPrice`, which retrieves the latest price data and returns it as an integer. Here we only return the value of the price feed, but any desired logic that depends on that feed can obvisouly be implemented.

To interact with the oracle, we added the interface for the two required functions.

Now that we have our smart contract, we need to deploy it to the Milkomeda C1 Mainnet. To do this, we will use Hardhat's deployment script. 

In the scripts directory of your project, create a new file called deploy.js. Then, add the following code:

```javascript
const hre = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
  const Feed = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("PriceFeedConsumer");
  const feed = await Feed.deploy();

  await feed.deployed();
  console.log(
    `PriceFeedConsumer deployed to ${feed.address}`
  );
}

main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});
```

This code uses the `ethers.js` library to deploy our `PriceFeedConsumer` and logs the address of the deployed contract to the console.

To deploy the contract on C1, we will create a .env file with the private key of our deployment address:

```
PRIVATE_KEY=<PRIVATE_KEY>
```

And we will change the hardhat.config.js by import our account and adding the C1 Testnet to the networks:


```javascript
require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");
require("dotenv").config();

/** @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig */
module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.18",
  networks: {
    c1: {
      url: `https://rpc-mainnet-cardano-evm.c1.milkomeda.com`,
      accounts: [`0x${process.env.PRIVATE_KEY}`]
    }
  }
};
```

Now we can deploy our contract. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network c1
```

Now that we have deployed our contract, we can call it from another smart contract or from a web3-enabled application. 
To call the `getPrice´ function from another smart contract, you can simply import the `PriceFeedConsumer´ and call the `getPrice` function, but let’s see an example of how to call it from a Hardhat script.

Create a file in the scripts folder called “callPriceFeed.js” and add the code below:

```javascript
const hre = require("hardhat");

const getPrice = async () => {
    const address = '0xd7a246726355961197c0E32d7914aDDa3dB3f4E4'
    const feed = await hre.ethers.getContractAt("PriceFeedConsumer", address);

    const price = await feed.getPrice()
    console.log(`USD/ADA: ${hre.ethers.utils.formatEther(price)}`)
}
  
getPrice()
```

Now run it by running the following:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/call.js --network c1
```

The result in the terminal look similar to this (although with a different price)"

**USD/ADA: 2.8398199554148265**

## Summary 

In this guide, we explored the Milkomeda Open Oracle, a decentralized oracle service that provides a price feed. We demonstrated two methods for fetching the data: (i) querying price data from the oracle contract using calls Javascript/Typescript and Python, and (ii) implementing the oracle interface to call the price feed for our own smart contract.

It's crucial to note that acceptance of the terms of service is mandatory for the calling address; otherwise, the call will fail.
