# Contract: Pillage

### Pillaging

Contracts that do not implement the `ableToWithdrawRewards` function (as explained [here](./contract_liquidstaking) forfeit their staking rewards, and these rewards will be pillaged by the Milkomeda DAO.

When an account is Pillaged, its accumulated rewards is removed and the value is automatically staked on behalf of the pillager (Milkomeda DAO).

```solidity
    function pillage(address _account, bytes32 _transactionId) external {
        // Ensure the msg.sender is a validator
        _assertValidator(msg.sender);

        // Add the validator vote, encoding the the data to be executed.
        // The staking smart contract has a function removeRewardsOnBehalf
        // that removes the rewards from an account that cannot withdraw rewards
        // and adds it as a stake for the pillager.
        Transaction memory transaction = _addTransaction(
            _transactionId,
            abi.encodeWithSignature("removeRewardsOnBehalf(address)", _account),
            stakingSCProxy
        );

        Status status = _confirmTransaction(_transactionId, transaction);
        if (status == Status.SUCCESS) {
            emit Pillaged(_account);
        }
    }
```

#### Example:

Smart contract `A` doesn't implement the `ableToWithdrawRewards` function - they stake 5 MilkADA and have accrued staking rewards of 3 MilkADA. Account `A` is then pillaged by the Milkomeda DAO - its rewards of 3 MilkADA is withdrawn, and staked on behalf of the pillager. Now the Milkomeda DAO has a stake balance of 3 MilkADA, and contract `A` has a stake balance of 5 MilkADA, but reward value of 0.
