# Milkomeda Liquid Staking

The general proposed solution works as follows:

Cardano user A want to use Milkomeda
A wraps 50 ADA and get 50 milkADA on Milkomeda. The ADA on the Cardano side is staked by to a pool chosen by the Milkomeda DAO
By default, users get no staking rewards at all (all the staking rewards go to the Milkomeda DAO)
A user on Milkomeda can wrap their milkADA into a smart contract (which locks their ADA for 1+ epoch) to get back stMilkADA which we encourage DEXs, etc. to support 1:1 with ADA
Milkomeda DAO shares staking rewards with stMilkADA holders every epoch

So now stMilkADA holders are getting their staking rewards while still being able to use Milkomeda

## Protocol Properties

A liquid staking protocol for Milkomeda should satisfy the following desirable properties:

- **No epoch missed**: if the user does the roundtrip L1 -> Milkomeda -> L1, they should not miss any reward epoch (they may receive less due to Milkomeda fees, but they should still receive something).<br/>
  _Note_: this means that for a 5 day epoch, if the user joins during day ⅖ , their next payout should be in 3 days just like the L1
- **No external oracles**: the protocol should not depend on the state of some oracle the Milkomeda DAO do not control
- **Non-wasteful**: if it’s clear rewards will never be claimable, the Milkomeda DAO should be able to take them as protocol revenue
- **Margin fee prepaid**: the DAO and other stakeholders should receive their share BEFORE being the public user reward pot is increased (no on-withdrawal attempt to calculate payouts for everyone)
- **No hard-coded epoch length**: the length of epochs may change at any time, so it should not be a hard-coded number. Payout period should match the L1 even if the L1 logic changes
- (Cardano specific) **No need to handle deregistration**: we assume the Milkomeda DAO will never deregister its staking key
- **Compatible with liquid staking L1**: For example, Cardano has no lockup period for its L1 staking
- **Compatible with non-liquid staking L1**: For example, Ethereum staking requires you to lock up your ETH for some period of time
  - **Liquidity Pool**: non-liquid staking L1s Milkomeda users should have a liquidity pool to go back to the native asset
- **Common engineering stack**: The protocol should leverage existing tools when possible. For example, if the protocol needs to send L1 funds to a L2 contract in one transaction, it can do this using the same engineering stack as wrapped smart contracts
- **Can be wrapped in an ERC20 token**: Either a new wStMilkADA or as wADA
- **Cannot be attacked by a flash loan**: users should not be able to loan ADA, stake it, pillage the reward pot and then return the ADA
- **No double-counting**: there should be no way to get rewarded twice for the same coins (ex: returning your ADA to the Cardano mainnet right before the epoch boundary every 5 days should give you no financial advantage)
- **Compounds**: rewards should automatically compound

## EVM Smart Contracts

Milkomeda Liquid Staking is a Liquid Staking protocol deployed on Milkomeda network. It enables users to participate in staking on Cardano, while having their funds on the Milkomeda C1 chain by receiving a tokenized representation of the staked assets. Users are able to stake MilkADA to receive stMilkADA that accrues L1 (Cardano) staking rewards.

It's composed of 3 core contracts:

- **LiquidStaking**: The core staking contract.

- **StakedMilADA**:An ERC20 complian token used to represent stakers share of the pool.

* **Pillage**: A utility contract to withdraw rewards from smart contract account unable to withdraw their rewards
