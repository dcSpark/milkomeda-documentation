When considering Layer 2 adoption, users tend to value the pros and cons of moving from the Layer 1. The trade-off is normally taking advatange of the scalability of the Layer 2 (speed and cost) while abdicating some of the security of the Layer 1.

However, many blockchains nowadays have a reward system for users on their Layer 1 for participating in the staking/governance of the network,
and it is important that users keep earning these rewards even after they move to the Layer 2 network.

The concept of ongoing rewards beyond the layer 1 is highly beneficial for various reasons:

- It helps to enhance **user retention** by incentivizing users to remain engaged with the blockchain ecosystem. By offering rewards that extend to layer 2 solutions, users have a continuous incentive to actively participate and contribute to the network.
- The ability to earn layer 1 rewards on layer 2 adoption also **increases developer incentives**. L2 dApps can leverage the rewards earned on the layer 1 blockchain, providing an additional revenue stream and motivating developers to build and maintain innovative solutions on top of the layer 2 infrastructure.
- As users continue to stake their assets and earn rewards on different layers of the blockchain, the protocol benefits from **increased activity and transaction volume**, leading to potential revenue generation for the overall ecosystem.

To achieve this seamless continuity of rewards, Milkomeda has devoloped a **Liquid Staking** standard that allows users to participate in a staking protocol while maintaining custody of their funds and receiving a yield baring tokenized representation of those funds.
In the case of Cardano, users can stake their milkADA (tokenized representation of ADA) to receive stMilkADA, which accrues layer 1 staking rewards.

By implementing liquid staking and enabling the accumulation of rewards on layer 2 solutions, blockchain platforms like Cardano aim to create a holistic ecosystem that incentivizes user engagement, fosters developer innovation, and generates sustainable protocol revenue across multiple layers of the network.
