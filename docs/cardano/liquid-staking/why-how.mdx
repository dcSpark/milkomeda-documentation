Many blockchains nowadays have rewards for their layer 1 users for participating in staking / governance. For sidechain / layer 2 adoption, it is important that users can continue earning their rewards even after they leave the layer 1.

This is beneficial as it
1. Helps user retention
2. Increases developer incentives (L2 dapps can earn L1 rewards)
3. Helps generate protocol revenue

To achieve this, we use **liquid staking** which we define as the ability to participate in a staking protocol while either maintaining custody of the funds or receiving ownership of a tokenized representation of those funds.

Notably, we achieve this by allowing users to (using Cardano as an example) stake their *milkADA* to receive a *stMilkADA* that accrues L1 staking rewards
