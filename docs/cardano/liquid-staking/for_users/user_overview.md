# Staking Guide

The **Milkomeda Liquid Staking** frontend is a secure and user-friendly way for users to interact with the protocol and to perform all user actions: staking, unstaking and claiming rewards. On the [homepage](https://liquidstaking-dev.milkomeda.com/), users can view all relevant statistics on Milkomeda Liquid Staking and the supported chains (currently Cardano only).

From a users' perpective Milkomeda Liquid Staking is very simple: mADA is staked into the liquid staking smart contract in return for stMADA and ADA rewards will accrue to its holder.



Stake your mADA using Milkomeda Liquid Staking today on the following [link](https://liquidstaking-dev.milkomeda.com/)

### Staking mADA

Staking can be performed by navigating to the staking page, that contains the "Stake" and "Unstake" tabs.

On this page users can stake their mADA by folowing these steps:

1. Connecting a wallet (e.g Flint, Metamask, etc)
1. Select "Stake" tab
1. Enter the desired amount, accept Terms of Use and press "Stake" button

The page will also show the user's available mADA and his current share of the total staked amount. 


:::note
A prior step to be able to stake on Milkomeda C1 is to wrap ADA from Cardano. To move your funds from Mainnet to Milkomeda C1, please follow this [guide](/cardano/for-end-users/obtaining-milkada).

#### Difference between stMADA vs MADA

By default, users get no staking rewards and the staking rewards go to the Milkomeda DAO. To receive staking rewards on your asset, users need to stake assets to get stMADA.

stMADA is the staked version of MilkADA, that accrues staking rewards in the Milkomeda Liquid Staking Protocol

### Unstaking

The steps to unstake stMADA are basically the opposite of staking. Users can unstake their stMADA using the Milkomeda DApp:

The requires steps are:

1. Go to (https:)
1. Connecting a wallet (e.g Flint, Metamask, etc)
1. Go to "Staking" page and "Unstake" tab
1. Enter the desired amount, accept Terms of Use and press "Stake" button

:::note
Milkomeda is encouraging DEXs, and other protocols to support stMADA 1:1 with MADA, so that the yield bearing version of the token can become the most used asset on the network

### Claiming the rewards

You can claim your rewards every epoch (unlike Cardano where you have to wait multiple epochs before your first reward). As a user, rewards can be claimed through the liquid staking dApp.
