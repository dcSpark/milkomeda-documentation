# Staking for Users




### Wrap your assets (mADA)

To move your funds from Mainnet to Milkomeda C1, pela check out the following [guide](/cardano/for-end-users/obtaining-milkada).



### Stake assets to get stMADA

Milkomeda provides a DApp on the following [link](http://localhost:3001/staking) to enable users to stake their assets.

The requires steps are:
1. Go to (https:)
1. Connecting a wallet (e.g Flint, Metamask, etc)
1. Go to "Staking" page and "Stake" tab
1. Enter the desired amount, accept Terms of Use and press "Stake" button

  alt="Staking"

#### Difference between stMADA vs MADA

By default, users get no staking rewards and the staking rewards go to the Milkomeda DAO. To receive staking rewards on your asset, users need to stake assets to get stMADA.

stMADA is the staked version of MilkADA, that accrues staking rewards in the Milkomeda Liquid Staking Protocol



### Unstaking

The steps to unstake stMADA are basically the opposite of staking. Users can unstake their stMADA using the Milkomeda DApp:

The requires steps are:
1. Go to (https:)
1. Connecting a wallet (e.g Flint, Metamask, etc)
1. Go to "Staking" page and "Unstake" tab
1. Enter the desired amount, accept Terms of Use and press "Stake" button

  alt="Unstaking"

:::note
Milkomeda is encouraging DEXs, and other protocols to support stMADA 1:1 with MADA, so that the yield bearing version of the token can become the most used asset on the network

### Claiming the rewards

You can claim your rewards every epoch (unlike Cardano where you have to wait multiple epochs before your first reward). As a user, rewards can be claimed through the liquid staking dApp.
