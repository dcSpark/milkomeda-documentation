# Glossary

- **Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Consensus**: Cardano utilizes a PoS consensus algorithm called Ouroboros, which enables stakeholders to participate in the network's block validation process.

- **ADA Staking**: Staking in Cardano involves holding ADA and delegating it to a stake pool or running your own stake pool. ADA is the native cryptocurrency of the Cardano blockchain. By staking ADA, you support the network's security and decentralization.

- **Stake Pools**: Stake pools are entities responsible for creating and validating blocks on the Cardano blockchain. They consist of a pool operator and multiple ADA holders who delegate their stake to the pool. Stake pool operators handle the technical aspects of block production, while delegators contribute their stake and receive rewards in proportion to their stake.

- **Delegation**: ADA holders can delegate their stake to a stake pool of their choice, allowing the pool operator to include their stake in the pool's collective stake. Delegation does not require sending or transferring ADA to the pool, and your funds remain under your control at all times.

- **Rewards and Incentives**: Cardano's staking system offers incentives to participants. Stake pool operators and delegators receive rewards in the form of additional ADA for their contribution to the network's operation. Rewards are distributed based on the amount of stake delegated to a pool and the pool's performance in block production.

- **Ouroboros Protocol**: Cardano's Ouroboros protocol incorporates a system of epochs and slots to manage block production and reward distribution. An epoch consists of multiple slots, and at the end of each epoch, rewards are calculated and distributed to stake pool operators and delegators.

- **Decentralization and Security**: The Cardano network aims to achieve a high level of decentralization by encouraging a large number of stake pools. This ensures that no single entity or group controls a significant portion of the network's stake, reducing the risk of centralization and enhancing security.

- **ADA Liquidity**: Staking in Cardano is designed to be highly liquid. ADA holders can freely move their tokens, including staked ADA, without any waiting period or lock-up period. This allows for flexibility and easy access to funds when needed.
