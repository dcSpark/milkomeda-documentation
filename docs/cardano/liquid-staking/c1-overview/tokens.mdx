# *stMilkADA* vs *sstMilkADA*

This contract has two tokens:

| Ticker     | Name                     | Staking rewards  | Denominated in |
|------------|--------------------------|------------------|----------------|
| stMilkADA  | Staked Milk ADA          | Manually claimed | milkADA        |
| sstMilkADA | Share of Staked Milk ADA | Automatic        | Shares         |

The tradeoff is that
- stMilkADA is intuitive to use (denominated in milkADA), but requires manually claiming rewards (so you may not get your rewards if you store your milkADA inside a dApp)
- sstMilkADA is less intuitive as it is denominated in shares (which we will explain below) and as such its ADA value changes over time 

When you deposit milkADA into the contract, internally the contract computes how much of all staked ADA belongs to you and allocates shares appropriately

For example, if there is 45 milkADA locked in contract and you deposit 5 ADA, you will own 5 ADA of (45 + 5) total ADA, so you will have 10% ownership

This 10% ownership is what is meant to be (indirectly) represented by *sstMilkADA* (to see the formula the defines the amount of `sstMilkADA` given, see [contract overview](./contract-overview))

Many protocols in the past have experimented with automatically rebasing assets (assets where the value of the asset changes automatically overtime) as they can capture behavior like automatic accural of staking rewards. However, these rebasing tokens are historically hard to use with DeFi protocol (ex: most DEXs don't expect the value of a token to suddenly go up during an epoch boundary). To partially address this, *sstMilkADA* is denominated in shares instead of a rebased *milkADA* value.

To maintain a simple user experience, *stMilkADA* provided a token that requires a manual rebase (aka manually claiming accured rewards). This is both more similar to how Cardano works and also more intuitive for users (at the cost of losing the ability to claim your rewards if you send your tokens to a smart contract)
