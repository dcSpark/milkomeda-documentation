# Pillaging

Contracts that do not implement the `ableToWithdrawRewards` function (as explained [here](https://github.com/dcSpark/milkomeda-documentation/blob/liquid-staking/docs/cardano/liquid-staking/c1-overview/claim-rewards.mdx) forfeit their staking rewards, and these rewards will be pillaged by the Milkomeda DAO.

When an account is Pillaged, its accumulated rewards is removed and the value is automatically staked on behalf of the pillager (Milkomeda DAO).

### Example:

Smart contract `A` doesn't implement the `ableToWithdrawRewards` function - they stake 5 MilkADA and have accrued staking rewards of 3 MilkADA. Account `A` is then pillaged by the Milkomeda DAO - its rewards of 3 MilkADA is withdrawn, and staked on behalf of the pillager. Now the Milkomeda DAO has a stake balance of 3 MilkADA, and contract `A` has a stake balance of 5 MilkADA, but reward value of 0.
