# Dead Shares

To mitigate against inflation attacks, we stake on initialization of the [Liquid Staking contract](https://github.com/dcSpark/liquid-staking/blob/0cffd0d6bdaff73d67d72983f652e7f152ad8074/src/LiquidStaking/LiquidStaking.sol#L148), creating dead shares. In order to create dead shares, a value (`msg.value` > 0) must be sent when initializating the staking contract. And this value is used to create the first stake in the pool, which is needed to protect against inflation attacks. Creating dead shares doesn't entirely solve this problem, but it reduces the profit that could be made from it .This dead shares is minted to the deployer - it's expected this shares and stake will never be withdrawn, unstaked or redeemed
