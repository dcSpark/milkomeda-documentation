### Staking on Cardano

Staking is an integral part of the Cardano blockchain's consensus mechanism and incentivization system. This fundamental process empowers Cardano holders to actively engage with the network, contribute to its security, and be rewarded with additional ADA for their participation. Notably, staking plays a crucial role in maintaining the network's decentralization and overall security.

Cardano stands out as a leading network with one of the highest staking participation rates, surpassing even well-established projects like Ethereum, with close to three-quarters of the native token (ADA) staked.

When users stake their ADA, they cast a vote for a validator and join a pool alongside hundreds or thousands of other stakers. This process, known as delegating, enables ADA holders to delegate their assets to a specific pool, thereby increasing the pool's staked ADA. Higher staked pools have a greater likelihood of being selected to build blocks and earn rewards.

### Liquid Staking



In contemplating Layer 2 adoption, users often weigh the advantages and disadvantages of transitioning from Layer 1. While Layer 2 offers improved scalability in terms of speed and cost, there may be some trade-offs in terms of security compared to Layer 1.

However, since many blockchains offer rewards to users for participating in staking and governance on Layer 1, it becomes crucial to ensure that users continue to earn these rewards even after moving their funds to Layer 2 networks.


The concept of ongoing rewards beyond Layer 1 offers several compelling benefits:

- **Enhanced User Retention**: By extending rewards to Layer 2 solutions, users have a continuous incentive to remain actively engaged with the blockchain ecosystem. This boosts user retention and encourages ongoing participation and contribution to the network.

- **Increased Developer Incentives**: Adoption of Layer 2 by dApps can utilize the rewards earned on Layer 1, providing an additional revenue stream for developers. This fosters a vibrant environment for building and maintaining innovative solutions on top of the Layer 2 infrastructure.

- **Boosted Activity and Transaction Volume**: As users continue to stake their assets and earn rewards on different layers of the blockchain, the protocol experiences heightened activity and transaction volume. This, in turn, contributes to potential revenue generation for the entire ecosystem.

### Milkomeda Liquid Staking

To enable a seamless continuity of rewards, **Milkomeda** has developed a **Liquid Staking** standard that enables users to participate in a staking protocol while retaining custody of their funds. Users receive a yield-bearing tokenized representation of their staked assets, ensuring they continue to earn rewards effortlessly.

In the case of Cardano, users can stake their mADA (a wrapped representation of ADA) to receive stmADA, which accrues layer 1 staking rewards.

By implementing **Liquid Staking** and enabling rewards accumulation on Layer 2 solutions, blockchain platforms like Cardano aim to create an ecosystem that incentivizes user engagement, fosters developer innovation, and generates sustainable protocol revenue across multiple layers of the network. This approach ensures the network's continued growth and success while rewarding active participants.
