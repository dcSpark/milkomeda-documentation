# FAQs


### 1. What is liquid staking?

Liquid staking allows users to stake their proof-of-stake (PoS) assets while also receiving a liquid representation of those assets. This enables users to earn staking rewards while having the flexibility to use their staked assets in other ways, such as trading or participating in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.


### 2. How does Milkomeda Liquid Staking work?
Milkomeda Liquid Staking is a decentralized standard that allows users to participate in a staking protocol while maintaining custody of their funds and receiving a yield baring tokenized representation of those funds. In the case of Cardano, users can stake their milkADA (tokenized representation of ADA) to receive stMilkADA, which accrues layer 1 staking rewards.

### 3. What are the benefits of using Milkomeda Liquid Staking?

- **Liquidity:** With Milkomeda Liquid Staking, users receive liquid stMADA tokens, allowing them to use their staked MADA in various DeFi applications or trade it on exchanges.
- **Continuous Earnings:** Users earn staking rewards in the form of additional stMADA tokens.

### 4. How are staking rewards distributed with Milkomeda Liquid Staking?
Lido distributes staking rewards proportionally to stETH holders based on their stake in the protocol. These rewards are automatically added to the user's stETH balance over time. The amount of staking rewards earned depends on various factors, including the total amount of ETH staked, validator performance, and the Ethereum 2.0 network's overall staking rewards rate.

### 6. How can I unstake my assets from Lido?
Unstaking with Lido is a straightforward process. Users can initiate the unstaking process by redeeming their stETH tokens for ETH. There is a cooldown period (currently set at around 24 hours) during which the stETH tokens are locked. After the cooldown period, users can burn their stETH tokens, and the equivalent amount of ETH will be returned to their designated Ethereum address.

### 7. Is my stake at risk when using Lido?
While Lido takes precautions to secure the staked ETH, no system is entirely without risk. Validators in the Lido network are carefully selected and monitored to minimize risks, but there is still a possibility of slashing events or validator malfunctions. However, Lido's design aims to mitigate these risks by distributing staked assets across multiple validators, reducing the impact of any single failure.

### 8. Are there any fees associated with using Lido?
Yes, Lido charges fees to cover the operational costs of maintaining the protocol. These fees are deducted from the staking rewards generated by the protocol. The exact fee structure can vary over time, and users should refer to the Lido documentation or interface for the most up-to-date fee information.

### 9. Can I use Lido with other proof-of-stake assets?
Lido is primarily focused on Ethereum 2.0 staking, but there are other liquid staking protocols available for different proof-of-stake assets. Some protocols support assets like SOL (Solana), DOT (Polkadot), and ATOM (Cosmos). If you are interested in liquid staking with other assets, it's recommended to explore protocols specifically designed for those networks.

### 10. Is Lido decentralized?
Lido aims to be a decentralized protocol, but it's important to note that it does rely on a set of validators to stake the pooled assets. These validators are selected and monitored by the Lido community and must meet certain criteria. The governance of Lido is gradually transitioning to a more decentralized model, allowing token holders to participate in decision-making processes.
