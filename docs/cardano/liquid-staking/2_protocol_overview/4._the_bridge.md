## The Milkomeda DAO

The Milkomeda DAO is a governance structure that lies at the core of the protocol. Users will have the ability to vote within the DAO (which exists on Cardano mainnet) on a wide range of topics from choosing the validator set of nodes that support the sidechains, adding brand new sidechains, spending treasury funds, and more.

The Milkomeda DAO is key for the underlying game theoretic assumptions to work, wherein the users who vote will truly be responsible for many things, such as ensuring that bad acting validating nodes are hastily removed so that all of the sidechains keep working without issue. As such, users who choose to vote are rewarded for doing so in order to incentivize participation.
