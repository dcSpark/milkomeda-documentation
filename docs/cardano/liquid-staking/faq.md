What is liquid staking?
</summary>
<p>


Liquid staking allows users to stake their proof-of-stake (PoS) assets while also receiving a liquid representation of those assets. This enables users to earn staking rewards while having the flexibility to use their staked assets in other ways, such as trading or participating in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.

How does Milkomeda Liquid Staking work?
</summary>
<p>

Milkomeda Liquid Staking is a decentralized standard that allows users to participate in a staking protocol while maintaining custody of their funds and receiving a yield baring tokenized representation of those funds. In the case of Cardano, users can stake their mADA (tokenized representation of ADA) to receive stMADA, which accrues layer 1 staking rewards.

Why would someone choose liquid staking over traditional staking?
</summary>
<p>

Liquid staking provides flexibility, as it allows users to stake their assets and still have access to their funds for other purposes, such as trading or participating in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.

Liquid staking vs traditional staking many times refers to chains where the staked assets cannot be used, like in Ethereum for example. In the case of Cardano, staked (or delegated) asset do remain usable, but in this case Milkomeda Liquid Staking refers to the fact that assets can be used on the Layer 2 while being staked on the Layer 1 (Cardano Mainnet)
