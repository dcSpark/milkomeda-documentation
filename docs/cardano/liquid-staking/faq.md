What is liquid staking?
</summary>
<p>


Liquid staking allows users to stake their proof-of-stake (PoS) assets while also receiving a liquid representation of those assets. This enables users to earn staking rewards while having the flexibility to use their staked assets in other ways, such as trading or participating in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.

How does Milkomeda Liquid Staking work?
</summary>
<p>

Milkomeda Liquid Staking is a decentralized standard that allows users to participate in a staking protocol while maintaining custody of their funds and receiving a yield baring tokenized representation of those funds. In the case of Cardano, users can stake their milkADA (tokenized representation of ADA) to receive stMilkADA, which accrues layer 1 staking rewards.

Why would someone choose liquid staking over traditional staking?
</summary>
<p>

Liquid staking provides flexibility, as it allows users to stake their assets and still have access to their funds for other purposes, such as trading or participating in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.

Liquid staking vs traditional staking many times refers to chains where the staked assets cannot be used, like in Ethereum for example. In the case of Cardano, staked (or delegated) asset do remain usable, but in this case Milkomeda Liquid Staking refers to the fact that assets can be used on the Layer 2 while being staked on the Layer 1 (Cardano Mainnet)

**Liquid Staking vs. Regular Staking**
Instead of having their crypto locked up in the protocol or network in the case of regular staking, liquid staking users can use their derivative tokens to further participate in DeFi activities to stack their yield on top of regular staking annual percentage returns (APRs).

Liquid staking also ensures greater decentralization in securing the network by lowering the barriers of entry to stake. The more validators present on the network, the more robust and secure the PoS network will be. In the case of post-Merge Ethereum, the minimum stake for a validator node is 32 ETH, which could be a significant sum of money for many retail users. With liquid staking, users can take part in the securing of Ethereum and receive the rewards without having to fork out the entire minimum amount of 32 ETH.





Please note that this FAQ provides a general overview and may not cover all aspects of liquid staking.
