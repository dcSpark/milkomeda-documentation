Milkomeda A1 Rollup is fully operational on Mainnet, which means that it is currently deployed and connected to production version of the Algorand blockchain.
:::
**Milkomeda is a protocol designed to improve blockchain interoperability by delivering EVM capabilities to non-EVM blockchains.** This is done by building layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions such as rollups, on which the EVM operates, and connecting these to the non-EVM blockchains, layer 1 (L1), via a permission-less bridge.

A rollup is described as a “layer 2” chain. Layer 2 means that it lives on top of an existing blockchain, which is called the layer 1 or main chain, and thus is able to take advantage of the layer 1’s native, built-in properties.

**The Milkomeda A1 Rollup uses mALGO as its base asset for paying fees and gas.** To access the A1 Rollup Mainnet, you will need a Algorand native wallet with some $ALGO, as well as the EVM-Compatible wallet such as MetaMask.

In the following pages we will walk through the steps to create a MyAlgo wallet, configure MetaMask to get a Milkomeda A1 Mainnet address, and, finally, to send ALGOs to be converted into mALGO on Milkomeda Algorand Rollup. In this tutorial, you will also learn how to transfer funds back to Algorand in a process called unwrapping.

In addition, we'll talk about what **Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs)** are and what you need to do to prepare to move these assets between the mainchain (Algorand) and the Rollup (Milkomeda).

The first step is to configure a native wallet on Algorand. In this tutorial we will use the MyAlgo wallet (you can also configure Pera Wallet, and with this you can interact with the DApp using a smartphone). Proceed to the next page to begin.
