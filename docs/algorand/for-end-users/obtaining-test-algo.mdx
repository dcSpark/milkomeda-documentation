# Configuring Algorand Wallet and obtaining Test ALGO
<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>
In order to interact with the **Milkomeda Algorand Rollup bridge**, you need to configure native Algorand Wallet. We recommend using MyAlgo wallet to setup a testnet wallet compatible with the Milkomeda A1 bridge (required to move funds between Algorand testnet and the Rollup).

<h4>Configuring myAlgo Wallet</h4>


First, go to https://wallet.myalgo.com/new-account and after accepting the _Terms of Service_ click _Continue_ to start configuring your wallet. In the next step you will be asked to create a password. Then you should **create a new randomly generated account**.

In the next step, you will be asked to save the Mnemonic Phrase.

:::info
Remember to take note of the following Mnemonic Phrase words in the correct order. They make the recovery phrase for your new account. 
:::
:::caution
Do not share these words with anyone! These words can be used to steal all your funds.
:::
Once Mnemonic Phrase has been successfully verified, your MyAlgo wallet has been configured and all that's left is to name your wallet with any name of your choice.

<h4>Obtaining Test ALGO</h4>

To interact with Bridge dApp you need to have ALGO tokens (tALGO tokens on devnet). 
To start we recommend getting some testnet ALGO from the official testnet dispenser [https://testnet.algoexplorer.io/dispenser](https://testnet.algoexplorer.io/dispenser).

Enter your newly created Algorand address and after waiting a few minutes (usually 2 minutes or less), you should be able to see some tALGO in your Algorand Testnet wallet.

Next we will set up **MetaMask Wallet** and get an address on the **Milkomeda A1 Algorand Rollup.**
