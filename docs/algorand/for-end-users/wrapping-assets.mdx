# Wrapping Assets
<p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>
In order to **transfer Assets from Algorand (mainchain) to Milkomeda A1 Rollup **, you need to use dedicated Bridge dApp.
To wrap your assets onto A1 Rollup go to the Milkomeda A1 bridge dApp at https://algorand-bridge-dev.milkomeda.com/.
To start wrapping your assets, choose **Algorand to Milkomeda** direction from **Network Origin** dropdown button. 
Then select the token you want to wrap ( in this tutorial, we will choose the ALGO token) from **Select Token** dropdown button.

The next step will be to log in to the MyAlgo and Metamask wallets. 
<ol>
<li>Click “Connect Wallet” on the Origin side and your MyAlgo wallet (we recently also added Pera Wallet support) will require you to enter the password and confirm which account to connect to the dApp. 
Your available ALGO balance will then be displayed below the select token field.</li>

<li>Click “Connect Wallet” on the Destination side of the dApp and your Metamask wallet will ask you to confirm that you want to switch networks (if you are not already connected to it) to the Milkomeda A1 network. Then you need to select and confirm which account connect to the dApp.</li>
</ol>

**Enter how many test ALGOs** you want to transfer to the A1 rollup (if you want to send your whole balance click “Max” to have the bridge calculate the maximum amount you can send minus the transaction fee). 

**Click “Next”** to view a transaction summary, complete with “Estimated Fees” and an “Estimated Wrapping Confirmation Time”.

**Click “Sign and Send”** , enter your wallet password and confirm and then watch as your tokens get sent to the bridge, wrapped, and sent to your Metamask wallet on the Milkomeda Algorand Rollup! The process should take around 20 seconds to confirm.

:::info
Remember that transactions from the Rollup are written to the Algorand Testnet blockchain itself. One confirmation is for sending the funds from the wallet to the bridge address and the second confirmation is for the rollup batch transaction on Algorand.
:::
The transfer only requires a total of 2 confirmations, which should take approximately 20 seconds (4.5 seconds for Algorand and around 14 seconds for the batch of the Rollup). Once the transaction is confirmed, the transferred MilkTALGO should be visible in your Milkomeda Algorand Testnet wallet in MetaMask.

You can now watch your transaction pass through the bridge.

**Congratulations!** You just wrapped your tokens onto the rollup outside of the Ethereum ecosystem!

Now that we have successfully wrapped Test ALGO into MilkTALGO for use on the Milkomeda A1 Algorand Rollup Testnet, let's see how to move assets back from Milkomeda A1 Rollup to Algorand.
