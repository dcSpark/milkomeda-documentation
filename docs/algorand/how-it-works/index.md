# How It Works

In this section, we will explain how the Milkomeda Rollup protocol for Algorand works. It's important to notice that multiple parts of the protocol are still under development, and this documentation will be updated as the protocol evolves.

The following sections are available:

- [Data Availability](data-availability.md)
- [Rollup Research Model](rollup-research-model.md)
- [Validators Election](validators-election.md)
- [Sequencer Election](sequencer-election.md)
- [Safe Exit Alternatives (Research)](safe-exit-alternatives.md)
