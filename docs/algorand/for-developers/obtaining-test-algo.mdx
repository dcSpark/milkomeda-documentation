# Obtaining Test ALGO

**Milkomeda A1 is available on Mainnet, as it is presently deployed and connected to the Algorand blockchain production version.** 
If you are familiar with the EVM stack, you can start interacting with the Milkomeda A1 Rollup on Mainnet right away. However, we recommend starting with the testnet to check your deployments. 
To start we recommend getting some testnet ALGO from the official testnet dispenser [https://testnet.algoexplorer.io/dispenser](https://testnet.algoexplorer.io/dispenser). Also currently we recommend using MyAlgo wallet [https://wallet.myalgo.com/](https://wallet.myalgo.com/) to setup a testnet wallet compatible with the Milkomeda A1 bridge (required to move funds between Algorand testnet and the Rollup).

After waiting a few minutes (usually 2 minutes or less), you should be able to see some tALGO in your Algorand Testnet wallet.

**Next we will set up MetaMask and get an address on the Milkomeda A1 Algorand Rollup Mainnet.**
