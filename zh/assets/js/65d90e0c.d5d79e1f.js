Furthermore, thanks to Cardano being PoS, when users transfer ADA to the sidechain it can be auto-delegated to stake pools which passively earns returns unlike using a new token as the base asset. This allows the sidechain to work synergistically with the Cardano mainnet in a manner where they build off of each other and the benefits of both bleed over to all users. Additionally, the relationship is strengthened by the fact that all of the fees users will be charged when interacting with the Milkomeda protocol (no matter on which chain) will be in ADA/mADA."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"By building this solid foundation between mainnet and the sidechain we also provide users a seriously improved UX, wherein by submitting a single transaction everything is dealt with automatically behind the scenes. For example, this translates into a smooth experience where users send their tokens to the sidechain bridge on Cardano mainnet, and the inner bridge machinery takes care of the series of subsequent transactions with no further user input. After a short period of time the tokens simply arrive on the sidechain in the user\u2019s wallet from their perspective.
