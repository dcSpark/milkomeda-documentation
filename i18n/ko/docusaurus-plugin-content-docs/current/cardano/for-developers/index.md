# 개발자 전용

Two versions of the Milkomeda C1 sidechain are currently operational. One is the devnet version, which uses test ADA and interacts with the Cardano Testnet. The the other is the mainnet version, which uses real ADA and interacts with the Cardano mainnet.

먼저 방향을 잡기 위해 devnet으로 시작하시기를 권장합니다. Once you're familiar with the devnet, the operations for mainnet are the same. The example steps that follow will show how to set up a connection to the devnet, with additional sections in red text indicating parameters and steps for using the mainnet.

Our first step is to install Flint Wallet. Proceed to the next page to begin.
