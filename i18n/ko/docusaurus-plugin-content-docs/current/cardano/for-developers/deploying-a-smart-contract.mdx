# Deploying a Smart Contract

Here we will deploy a Solidity smart contract on the Milkomeda C1 sidechain. In this example, we will use Remix [](http://remix.ethereum.org/) to deploy the contract. You can access Remix by visiting the following link: [Remix IDE](http://remix.ethereum.org/)â€‹

First, create the solidity smart contract file. Inside the Remix window, click the "**Contracts**" folder in the left panel, then click the "**New File**" button in the central panel.

Now you will be prompted to enter a filename for a new Solidity smart contract. The filename is arbitrary, but for the purposes of this example we will be deploying an ERC-20 smart contract so we will name the file "Test_ERC20.sol". Type the filename and press **Enter**. The cursor should move to the edit panel where you can input your Solidity code. Enter the following:

```
pragma solidity ^0.7.0;

import "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v3.4.0-solc-0.7/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract Token is ERC20 {

    constructor () ERC20("Token", "TKN") {
        _mint(msg.sender, 1000000 * (10 ** uint256(decimals())));
    }
}
```

Next, click the "**Solidity compiler**" icon on the left side of the screen, choose a compiler version (for this example we will use **0.7.6+commit.7338295f**), and then click "**Compile Test_ERC20.sol**", as shown.

Click the "**Deploy and run transactions**" icon on the left, and from the "**Environment**" pulldown select "**Injected Web3**", as shown. This will bring up the MetaMask screen where you will need to click "**Next**" and then "**Connect**" to connect your C1 wallet with Remix.

With your MetaMask wallet now connected, click the "**Deploy**" button to deploy the smart contract to the Milkomeda C1 sidechain.

Confirm the transaction in MetaMask.

You should now see the following under "**Deployed Contracts**" on the left side of the Remix IDE screen.

Finally, let's look at how to unwrap our milkTADA back into tADA on the Cardano Testnet.
