**Milkomeda는 EVM 기능을 non-EVM 블록체인에 제공하여 블록체인의 상호 운용성을 개선하도록 설계된 프로토콜입니다.** 이는 EVM이 작동하는 롤업과 같은 레이어 2(L2) 확장 솔루션을 구축하고 연결함으로써 이루어집니다. 권한이 없는 브리지를 통해 EVM이 아닌 블록체인인 레이어 1(L1) 로 전송됩니다.

A rollup is described as a “layer 2” chain. Layer 2 means that it lives on top of an existing blockchain, which is called the layer 1 or main chain, and thus is able to take advantage of the layer 1’s native, built-in properties.

**The Milkomeda A1 Rollup uses MilkALGO as its base asset for paying fees and gas.** To access the Rollup, you will need a Algorand native wallet with some $ALGO, as well as the MetaMask wallet.

In the following pages we will walk through the steps to create a MyAlgo wallet, configure MetaMask to get a Milkomeda A1 address, and, finally, to send ALGOs to be converted into MilkALGO on Milkomeda Algorand Rollup. In this tutorial, you will also learn how to transfer funds back to Algorand in a process called unwrapping. In addition, we'll talk about what Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs) are and what you need to do to prepare to move these assets between the mainchain (Algorand) and the Rollup (Milkomeda).

The first step is to configure a native wallet on Algorand. In this tutorial we will use the MyAlgo wallet (you can also configure Pera Wallet, and with this you can interact with the dApp using a smartphone). 다음 페이지로 이동하여 단계를 개시합니다.
