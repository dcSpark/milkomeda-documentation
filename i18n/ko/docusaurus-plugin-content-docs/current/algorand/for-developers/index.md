Milkomeda A1 Rollup is fully operational on Mainnet, which means that it is currently deployed and connected to production version of the Algorand blockchain.
::: **Milkomeda is a protocol designed to improve blockchain interoperability by delivering EVM capabilities to non-EVM blockchains.** This is done by building layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions such as rollups, on which the EVM operates, and connecting these to the non-EVM blockchains, layer 1 (L1), via a permission-less bridge.

롤업은 "레이어 2" 체인으로 기술됩니다. 레이어 2는 레이어 1 또는 메인 체인이라고 하는 기존 블록체인 위에 존재하므로 레이어 1의 기본 제공 속성을 활용할 수 있음을 의미합니다. The Milkomeda A1 Rollup uses mALGO as its base asset for paying fees and gas. To access the Rollup, you will need a Algorand native wallet with some $ALGO, as well as the EVM-Compatible wallet such as Metamask.

In the following pages we will walk through the steps to create a MyAlgo wallet, configure MetaMask to get a Milkomeda A1 address, send ALGOs to be converted into mALGO on Milkomeda Algorand Rollup, and, finally, deploying a smart-contract.

조작에 익숙해지기 위해 먼저 Devnet을 이용하는 것을 권장합니다. **Once you’re familiar with the devnet, the operations for the mainnet are the same**. The example steps that follow will show how to set up a connection to the both **devnet** and **mainnet**.
