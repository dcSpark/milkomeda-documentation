# For Developers

Currently, only the Algorand Rollup Testnet is available, but we hope to launch Algorand Rollup Mainnet this quarter after more extensive QA and the finalization of our main audit.

About the Milkomeda A1 Devnet (Milkomeda's Algorand Rollup Testnet), it uses test ALGO and interacts with the official Algorand Testnet.

We recommend starting with the devnet to get oriented first. Once you're familiar with the devnet, the operations for the future mainnet will be the same. The example steps that follow will show how to set up a connection to the devnet. Later on we will update the documentation with an additional section in red text indicating parameters and steps for using the mainnet.
