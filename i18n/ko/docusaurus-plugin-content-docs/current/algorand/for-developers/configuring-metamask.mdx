:::note In the previous step, we demonstrated how to obtain test ALGO to start interacting with the Milkomeda A1 Rollup on the Testnet.

**Going forward, our documentation will concentrate on Mainnet settings.** However, we highly recommend that you begin by interacting with the Milkomeda A1 Rollup using Testnet funds. To accomplish this, you will need to modify the corresponding RPC settings to Testnet.

Now that we have an Algorand wallet and some ALGOs, we need an address on the Milkomeda Algorand A1 Rollup where we can receive our mALGO. We recommend using MetaMask for this step.

First, install [MetaMask for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn), then click the Chrome Extensions icon <img src={puzzleIcon} alt="" className="img-icon" /> and select MetaMask. MetaMask 창에서 **Get Started**(시작)를 클릭한 후 **Create a Wallet**(월렛 만들기)를 선택합니다. 월렛 비밀번호를 설정합니다. 이 후에 설정 화면이 표시되므로 클릭하여 계속 진행합니다. When you're finished, you will have a new, empty wallet, as shown below. Select the network dropdown in the top right corner of the MetaMask screen.

From the dropdown list, select “**Add Network**” and enter the following: :::info
> **Network Name:** Milkomeda Algorand mainnet
> 
> **New RPC URL:** https://rpc-mainnet-algorand-rollup.a1.milkomeda.com 
> 
> **Chain ID:** 2002
> 
> **Currency Symbol (Optional):** milkAlgo
> 
> **Block Explorer URL (Optional):** https://explorer-mainnet-algorand-rollup.a1.milkomeda.com
> 
> :::

To interact with Milkomeda A1 Testnet, use following network details:
> Network Name: Milkomeda Algorand Testnet
  <p> New RPC URL: https://rpc-devnet-algorand-rollup.a1.milkomeda.com </p>
  <p>Chain ID: 200202</p>
  <p>Currency Symbol (Optional): milkTALGO</p>
  <p>
>  {" "}
>  Block Explorer URL (Optional): https://testnet-algorand-rollup.a1.milkomeda.com{" "}
></p>
Click “**Save**”, and you will now see **Milkomeda Algorand** in the network dropdown list. Copy your Milkomeda Algorand wallet address from MetaMask to the clipboard by clicking on the account name, as shown.

**Next we will go to the Milkomeda A1 Bridge DApp and send our ALGO to the Bridge to be wrapped.**
