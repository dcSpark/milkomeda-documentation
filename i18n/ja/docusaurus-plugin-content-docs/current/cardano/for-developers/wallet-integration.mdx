# Wallet integration

Learn how to integrate your web3 wallet or other dApp with Milkomeda

## Start building the future of decentralized finances

The following article helps to get to know the _**milkomeda-js-sdk package**_ allowing developers to integrate web3 wallet on Milkomeda Sidechain.

## Integrate Wallet with Milkomeda protocol

**1. Download _milkomeda-js-sdk package_**

Here you can find the [milkomeda-js-sdk package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dcspark/milkomeda-js-sdk). This is a package that hosts static configurations of Milkomeda deployments.

:::info

This is useful to avoid having each project integrate Milkomeda hard-coding static configurations.

:::

**2. Install _milkomeda-js-sdk_ package**

To install the package using **npm**:

```shell
npm i @dcspark/milkomeda-js-sdk
```

To install the package using **yarn**:

```shell
yarn add @dcspark/milkomeda-js-sdk
```

**3. Import the package into your project**

Using **import:**

```js
import { generateMilkomedaMetadata, milkomedaNetworks } from "@dcspark/milkomeda-js-sdk";
```

Using **require:**

```js
const milkomedaJsSdk = require("@dcspark/milkomeda-js-sdk");
```

| Parameter                  | Description                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _isMainnet_                | boolean informing if the specific network configuration is mainnet (e.g. Cardano) or not,                           |
| _mainchain_                | consists of mainchain information such as protocol and its id,                                                      |
| _sidechain_                | consists of sidechain information such as protocol name (e.g. MilkomedaC1) and sidechain id,                        |
| _backendEndpoint_          | provides URL value for the service, which exposes additional information about a specific version of the sidechain, |
| _protocolMagic_            | introduces protocol magic compatible with appropriate Milkomeda network,                                            |
| _timeIntervalForAddressMs_ | a time interval of a possible address change defined in milliseconds,                                               |
| _sidechainContract_        | address of the sidechain contract to which any client can connect.                                                  |

#### Example of the exposed payload

Below you can find an example of the exposed payload of one of the Milkomeda Networks (devnet)

```json
{
    [NETWORK_NAME]: {
        isMainnet: false,
        name: NETWORK_NAME,
        mainchain: {
            protocol: ProtocolNames.cardanoProtocol,
            id: toChainId({
                networkId: registry.Testnet.NetworkId,
                networkMagic: registry.Testnet.NetworkMagic
            })
        },
        sidechain: { protocol: ProtocolNames.evmProtocol, id: 200101 },
        backendEndpoint: BackendEndpoints.devnet,
        protocolMagic: ProtocolMagic.devnet,
        timeIntervalForAddressMs: 86400000,
        sidechainContract: "0x000000000000000000000000000000000000BbBB"
    },
}
```

Additionally, the package introduces helper types and a function that helps to create proper metadata for Milkomeda transactions.

```shell
# Milkomeda metadata generator
generateMilkomedaMetadata(
    address, # address is EVM address
    protocolMagic # protocol magic for specific network
)
```

The metadata of a transaction consists of two parameters - **protocol magic & EVM address**. Exemplary metadata for **testnet** transaction is as follows:

```json
{
    87: "devnet.cardano-evm.c1"
    88: "0xEVM_TESTNET_ADDRESS"
}
```

#### Example of generating Milkomeda metadata for transaction

```js
generateMilkomedaMetadata("0x000…", milkomedaNetworks["c1-devnet"].protocolMagic);
```

:::info
Remember to replace "0x000..." with your EVM address
:::

### Milkomeda REST API

Except for the _Milkomeda-js-sdk_ package, we have introduced a REST API that allows to fetch more data regarding the Milkomeda Sidechain itself.

:::info
In this example, we use the Flint Wallet integration example for a better explanation
:::

Base url for REST API is given as the **backendEndpoint** parameter using _milkomeda-js-sdk_. You can take it out from the package using the following code:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="devnet"
  values={[
    { label: "Devnet", value: "devnet" },
 { label: "Mainnet", value: "mainnet" },
 ]}
 className="border-[1px] border-gray-300"
>
<TabItem value="devnet">

```
milkomedaNetworks["c1-devnet"].backendEndpoint
```

:::info
Result: [https://allowlist.flint-wallet.com](https://allowlist.flint-wallet.com)
:::

When you have the base URL included in your code, you can use one of the following endpoint:

- **Stargate address** ([V1/stargate](https://allowlist.flint-wallet.com/v1/stargate))

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="mainnet">

```
milkomedaNetworks["c1-mainnet"].backendEndpoint
```

:::info
Result: [https://allowlist-mainnet.flint-wallet.com](https://allowlist-mainnet.flint-wallet.com)

If you want to integrate your Wallet with Milkomeda Mainnet, you need to use another 2 endpoints, to get EVM addresses allowed on the network. The purpose of this [microservice](https://github.com/dcSpark/allowedlist-service/) is to provide a list of addresses that are allowed to use the bridge in Milkomeda.
:::

When you have the base URL included in your code, you can use one of the following endpoints:

- **Stargate address** ([/V1/stargate](https://allowlist-mainnet.flint-wallet.com/v1/stargate))
- **fullAllowedList** ([/v1/fullAllowedList](https://allowlist-mainnet.flint-wallet.com/v1/fullAllowedList))

Returns array of EVM addresses allowed in the mainnet

```json
{
  "allowList": ["0x...", "0x..."]
}
```

- **isAddress=0x** ([/v1/isAddressAllowed?address=0x](https://allowlist-mainnet.flint-wallet.com/v1/isAddressAllowed?address=0x))

Returns a boolean value, which informs if the \*\*\*\* provided address is allowed on the restricted mainnet or not.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Using Milkomeda REST API stargate endpoint you can get the same properties of the payload for both devnet and mainnet. Below you can find an example payload for devnet:&#x20;

```json
{
    "current_address": "addr_test1wz6lvjg3anml96vl22mls5vae3x2cgaqwy2ewp5gj3fcxdcw652wz",
    "ttl_expiry": 1646438400000,
    "ada": {
        "minLovelace": "3000000",
        "fromADAFeeLovelace": "500000",
        "toADAFeeGWei": "500000"
    },
    "assets": [
        {
            "idCardano": "b4004c2f3edfdd2016d0fead9b927064f345534b000000000000000000000000",
            "idMilkomeda": "9c223e1dAf6184672E982d9AA560D9FD1d09A01B",
            "minCNTInt": "1",
            "minGWei": "1000000000"
        }
    …
    ]
}
```
