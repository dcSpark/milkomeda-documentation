# テストALGOの取得

:::info Milkomeda A1 Rollup is fully operational on Mainnet, which means that it is currently deployed and connected to production version of the Algorand blockchain.

If you are familiar with the EVM stack, you can start interacting with the Milkomeda A1 Rollup on Mainnet right away. However, we recommend starting with the testnet to check your deployments. はじめに、公式のTestnetディスペンサー [https://testnet.algoexplorer.io/dispenser](https://testnet.algoexplorer.io/dispenser) からTestnet ALGOを取得することをおすすめします。 Also currently we recommend using Pera Wallet [https://web.perawallet.app](https://web.perawallet.app) to setup a testnet wallet compatible with the Milkomeda A1 bridge (required to move funds between Algorand testnet and the Rollup).

数分待つと（通常は2分程度）、Algorand TestnetウォレットにtALGOが表示されます。

**Next we will set up MetaMask and get an address on the Milkomeda A1 Algorand Rollup Mainnet.**
