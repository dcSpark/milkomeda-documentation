# 给终端用户

The Milkomeda C1 sidechain uses MilkADA as its base asset for paying fees and gas. To access the sidechain, you will need a Cardano wallet with some ADA as well as the MetaMask browser extension.

On the following pages we will walk through the steps to create a Cardano wallet in Flint, configure MetaMask to get a Milkomeda C1 address, and finally send ADA to be converted into MilkADA on Milkomeda C1.

我们的第一步是安装Flint钱包。 前往下一页开始。
