# 给终端用户

:::info Milkomeda C1 **Testnet** is not recommended for use at this time due to recent Cardano Testnet developments. New dedicated preview and pre-production Cardano Testnet environments are being introduced and old Testnet is going to be deprecated very soon. Due to that fact there may appear difficulties with moving funds between Cardano and Milkomeda C1 Sidechain (Testnet).

Taking this into consideration, we recommend all users who would like to deploy their contracts on Milkomeda C1 Sidechain (Testnet), to perform testing on any other EVM-compatible chain instead. The main issue is that to pay the fees on Milkomeda C1 Testnet, one must wrap test assets using Cardano Testnet which may not be possible.

Thanks to Milkomeda C1 EVM-compatibility, such contracts can be deployed on any Ethereum Virtual Machine, so even if a contract is tested elsewhere, it will work on the Milkomeda C1 Sidechain. :::

Milkomeda C1侧链使用MilkADA作为其基础资产，用于支付费用和gas。 要访问侧链，你将需要一个有一些ADA的Cardano钱包以及MetaMask浏览器扩展。

在以下几页中，我们将通过以下步骤来创建一个Flint的Cardano钱包，配置MetaMask以获得Milkomeda C1的地址，最后发送ADA以转换为Milkomeda C1的MilkADA。

我们的第一步是安装Flint钱包。 前往下一页开始。
