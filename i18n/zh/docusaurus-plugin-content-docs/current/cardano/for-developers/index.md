# 给开发者

:::info Milkomeda C1 **Testnet** is not recommended for use at this time due to recent Cardano Testnet developments. New dedicated preview and pre-production Cardano Testnet environments are being introduced and old Testnet is going to be deprecated very soon. Due to that fact there may appear difficulties with moving funds between Cardano and Milkomeda C1 Sidechain (Testnet).

Taking this into consideration, we recommend all users who would like to deploy their contracts on Milkomeda C1 Sidechain (Testnet), to perform testing on any other EVM-compatible chain instead. The main issue is that to pay the fees on Milkomeda C1 Testnet, one must wrap test assets using Cardano Testnet which may not be possible.

Thanks to Milkomeda C1 EVM-compatibility, such contracts can be deployed on any Ethereum Virtual Machine, so even if a contract is tested elsewhere, it will work on the Milkomeda C1 Sidechain. ::: Two versions of the Milkomeda C1 sidechain are currently operational. 一个是devnet版本，它使用测试ADA并与Cardano Testnet互动。 另一个是主网版本，它使用真实的ADA并与Cardano主网互动。

我们建议先从devnet开始，以了解其方向。 一旦你熟悉了devnet，对未来主网的操作也将是一样的。 下面的例子步骤将显示如何设置与devnet的连接，另外的部分用红色文字表示参数和使用主网的步骤。

我们的第一步是安装Flint钱包。 前往下一页开始。
