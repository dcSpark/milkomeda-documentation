# 获取测试ALGO

:::info
Milkomeda A1 Rollup is fully operational on Mainnet, which means that it is currently deployed and connected to production version of the Algorand blockchain.
:::

If you are familiar with the EVM stack, you can start interacting with the Milkomeda A1 Rollup on Mainnet right away. However, we recommend starting with the testnet to check your deployments. 首先，我们建议从官方的测试网分配器 [https://testnet.algoexplorer.io/dispenser](https://testnet.algoexplorer.io/dispenser) 获得一些测试网ALGO。 Also currently we recommend using Pera Wallet [https://web.perawallet.app](https://web.perawallet.app) to setup a testnet wallet compatible with the Milkomeda A1 bridge (required to move funds between Algorand testnet and the Rollup).

等待几分钟后(通常2分钟或更短)，你应该能在你的Algorand Testnet钱包中看到一些tALGO。

**Next we will set up MetaMask and get an address on the Milkomeda A1 Algorand Rollup Mainnet.**
