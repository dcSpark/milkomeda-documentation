# 设置MetaMask

:::note
In the previous step we showed you how to get the ALGO testnet to start interacting with Milkomeda A1 Rollup Testnet.
From now on, documentation will be focused on mainnet settings. Nevertheless, we recommend that you first interact with Milkomeda A1 Rollup using testnet funds. For this purpose change the corresponding RPC settings to Testnet.
Please keep in mind, that all the steps described for mainnet settings are the same as the ones for testnet.
