Milkomeda A1 Rollup is fully operational on Mainnet, which means that it is currently deployed and connected to production version of the Algorand blockchain.
::: **Milkomeda is a protocol designed to improve blockchain interoperability by delivering EVM capabilities to non-EVM blockchains.** This is done by building layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions such as rollups, on which the EVM operates, and connecting these to the non-EVM blockchains, layer 1 (L1), via a permission-less bridge.

A rollup is described as a “layer 2” chain. A rollup is described as a “layer 2” chain. Layer 2 means that it lives on top of an existing blockchain, which is called the layer 1 or main chain, and thus is able to take advantage of the layer 1’s native, built-in properties. The Milkomeda A1 Rollup uses mALGO as its base asset for paying fees and gas. To access the Rollup, you will need a Algorand native wallet with some $ALGO, as well as the EVM-Compatible wallet such as Metamask.

In the following pages we will walk through the steps to create a MyAlgo wallet, configure MetaMask to get a Milkomeda A1 address, send ALGOs to be converted into mALGO on Milkomeda Algorand Rollup, and, finally, deploying a smart-contract.

我们建议先从devnet开始，以了解其方向。 **Once you’re familiar with the devnet, the operations for the mainnet are the same**. The example steps that follow will show how to set up a connection to the both **devnet** and **mainnet**.
