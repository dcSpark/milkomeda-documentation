# Configuring Algorand Wallet and obtaining Test ALGO

In order to interact with the **Milkomeda Algorand Rollup Bridge**, you need to configure a native Algorand wallet. We recommend using MyAlgo wallet to setup a testnet wallet compatible with the Milkomeda A1 Bridge.

### Configuring Your MyAlgo Wallet

First, go to [https://wallet.myalgo.com/new-account](https://wallet.myalgo.com/new-account). After accepting the _Terms of Service_ click _Continue_ to start configuring your wallet. In the next step you will be asked to create a password. Then you should **create a new randomly generated account**.

In the next step you will be asked to save the Mnemonic Phrase.

:::info
Remember to take note of the following Mnemonic Phrase words in the correct order. They are the recovery phrase for your new account.
:::  
:::caution
Do not share these words with anyone! These words can be used to steal all your funds.
:::  
Once you've successfully verified the Mnemonic Phrase your MyAlgo wallet has been configured and all that's left to do is to give your wallet a name of your choosing.

### 获取测试ALGO

To interact with the Bridge dApp you need to have the testnet ALGO token, ALGO. 首先，我们建议从官方的测试网分配器 [https://testnet.algoexplorer.io/dispenser](https://testnet.algoexplorer.io/dispenser) 获得一些测试网ALGO。

Enter your newly created Algorand address and after waiting a few minutes (usually 2 minutes or less), you should be able to see some tALGO in your Algorand Testnet wallet.

Next we will set up **MetaMask Wallet** and get an address on the **Milkomeda A1 Algorand Rollup.**
